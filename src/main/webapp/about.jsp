            Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played at Anfield since its
            formation. Liverpool established itself as a major force in English and European football in the 1970s and
            1980s when Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley led the club to 11 League titles and seven European trophies. Under
            the management of Rafael Benítez and captained by Steven Gerrard, Liverpool became European champions for the
            fifth time in 2005.

            The club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies: the Heysel Stadium disaster, where escaping
            fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the 1985 European Cup Final in Brussels, with 39 people –
            mostly Italians and Juventus fans – dying, after which English clubs were given a five-year ban from European
            competition, and the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 96 Liverpool supporters died in a crush against
            perimeter fencing.
